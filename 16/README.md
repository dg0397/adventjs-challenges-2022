# Challenge #16: Fixing Santa Claus' letters

## Description

Santa Claus is starting to receive a lot of letters but they have some formatting problems. To improve readability, he will write a program that given a text, formats it according to the following rules:

Remove spaces at the beginning and end of the prase

Remove multiple spaces and leave only one

Leave a space after each comma and point

Remove spaces before comma or point

Questions must only end with a question mark

The first letter of each sentence must be capitalized

Put the word "Santa Claus" in uppercase if it appears in the letter

Put a point at the end of the sentence if it does not have punctuation

Letters are written in English and here we have an example:

```javascript
Place on top :    P     R     B     P
If below is  :   P P   B P   R P   B R
```
The combinations are also reversed. For example, if below is B P, above is R. But it will also be R if below is P B. Also if below you have repeated the letter, above you use the same letter. For example: if below is B B, above is B.

With these rules, we could see the tree that we would generate with the base B P R P:

```javascript
fixLetter(` hello,  how are you??     do you know if santa claus exists?  i really hope he does!  bye  `)
// Hello, how are you? Do you know if Santa Claus exists? I really hope he does! Bye.

fixLetter("  Hi Santa claus. I'm a girl from Barcelona , Spain . please, send me a bike.  Is it possible?")
// Hi Santa Claus. I'm a girl from Barcelona, Spain. Please, send me a bike. Is it possible?

```
### üìù Keep in mind

You do not have to worry about punctuation marks other than comma, point or question mark.

Make sure you respect break lines and original whitespaces.
